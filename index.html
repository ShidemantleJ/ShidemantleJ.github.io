									<h1>About Me</h1>
								</header>
								<h3>Introduction</h3>
								<p style="color:black">
									My name is John Shidemantle and I'm a Freshman at the University of Alabama pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science.
								</p>
								<h3>Personal Narrative</h3>
								<p style="color:black">
									During my Junior year of high school, I had the opportunity to stay with my dad, a college professor, in Israel for 3 months to help him
									film and edit lectures for his students. Over this time, I became fascinated by the many different cultures and traditions I was exposed to and,  
									being in a country that is a center of technological innovation, I discovered how programming can be used for many different purposes, including 
									solving problems and bringing people together.
								</p>
								<h3>Interests and Passions</h3>
								<p style="color:black">
									I am interested in and passionate about many things, including computer science, machine learning, and microprocessors. I also like to attend 
									Rubik's cube competitions and often practice. You can check out my World Cube Association profile <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2017SHID01">here</a>.
								</p>
								<h3>Values and Beliefs</h3>
								<p style="color:black">
									I believe that any problem can be solved through sufficient cooperation and perseverance, no matter the magnitude of the problem or the resource constraints. 
									I also believe that now that the knowledge of all of humanity is available on the internet, it is easier more than ever to formulate solutions to problems using 
									computing resources available to anyone. It was Will Smith's character in <i>The Pursuit of Happyness</i> that said it best: "
									I'm the type of person that if you ask me a question and I don't know the answer, I'm gonna tell you that I don't know. But I bet you what, I know how to find the answer and I will find the answer."
								</p>
								<h3>Strengths and Areas of Growth</h3>
								<p style="color:black">
									I believe that I am a good team player, and i've worked on many projects which required a high extent of collaboration and benefitted greatly from taking in others' points of view. 
									From these projects, I learned that listening is one of the most valuable tools at my disposal, and taking in others' points of view is an excellent shortcut to problem solving. 
									I also feel that I am a good learner, but I know there is always more to learn and I strive to learn something new every day. I believe that the best way for me to grow is to take in 
									as much information as possible and do all that I can to learn as much as I can.

									<h1>Skills</h1>
									<p style="color:black">
										I am always striving to learn new skills, and all of my open source programming-related projects will be made available <a href="https://github.com/ShidemantleJ">here</a> as soon as 
										they are published. I am currently learning mobile app development with the Flutter framework, C/C++, and Python. Throughout my academic career at the University of Alabama, 
										I will be developing these skills and releasing new projects at the aforementioned link as soon as I finish them.
